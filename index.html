                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I am a self motivated engineer dedicated to constant learning and improvement. I have been self-taught since 2014 and attended college intending to receive a BS in Computer Science. I chose to withdraw because I was not learning nearly as much pursuing a formal education as I was teaching myself. I decided to solidify the knowledge I had taught myself and enrolled in General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive course in April 2020. Having graduated the course I consider myself a full stack engineer speciailizing in backend.</p>
